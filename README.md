# Monte_Carlo_Simulation
 Simulation of the game Craps.

## Goals

'''
    Part 1: Roll 2 dice a specified number of times.
        - A win is 7 or 11
        - A loss is 2, 3, or 12
        - Continue to Part 2 if a roll was not a win or loss
    
    Part 2: Roll until win/loose
        - Win if re-roll number from Part 1 again
        - Loss if 7

This is a method to find the probability of winning craps by simulating the game a large number of times.
